# Gonzalo Pozzi's Portfolio index page

Below, I'll be posting every portfolio project done to hone my data skills and to showcase what I've learned

Let's get to it

- üí¨ [NLP](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/acamica-data-scientist/nlp): The goal of this project is to be able to predict the score that a user would set given a review by using an Amazon dataset that contained reviews about different products. `Stopwords removal` `Stemming` `Lemmatization` `Seaborn` `Matplotlib` `Wordcloud` `Tf-Idf` `GaussianNB` `Random Forest` `LinearSVC` `GridsearchCV`

- üê∂ [Dognition](https://github.com/gpozzi/sql-projects/tree/main/managing-big-data-with-sql/dognition): MySQL scripts that query a database of a company that sells dogs personality tests. A thorough data exploration has been performed to figure out what business changes it could implement to increase the number of tests users complete on their website. `MySQL` `Exploratory Data Analysis`

- üèÖ [#mavenolympicschallenge](https://github.com/gpozzi/data-visualization/tree/main/olympics-dashboard): Given a dataset with 271.116 athletes that participated into different Olympics editions from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, I developed a dashboard to capture the history of the Olympic Games. `Dataviz` `Tableau` `Figma`.

- üöÄ [Rocket launches, a best value analysis](https://github.com/gpozzi/python-analytics-projects/tree/main/space_launches): Data cleaning and wrangling project in which I applied transformation and data cleaning techniques to a messy dataset to detect which countries able to launch rockets have the lowest average price per kilo that can launch rockets into Low Earth Orbit

- üëî [Dillards](https://github.com/gpozzi/sql-projects/tree/main/managing-big-data-with-sql/dillards): exploratory data analysis queries to figure out relevant data about Dillard's sales dataset.`Teradata` `Exploratory Data Analysis`

- üí∞ [#mavencrowdfundingchallenge](https://github.com/gpozzi/data-visualization/tree/main/crowdfunding): Given a dataset with over 375.000 projects uploaded to Kickstarter, had to analyze which factors may predict projects success. `Dataviz` `Tableau`

- üèòÔ∏è [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/acamica-data-scientist/house_price_prediction): I have recently joined the Data team of a large real estate company. The first task assigned is to help appraisers value properties, as it's a difficult and sometimes subjective process. To do this, I should develop a Machine Learning model that, given certain characteristics of the property, predicts its sale price. `Preprocessing` `Seaborn` `Matplotlib` `LinearRegression` `KNeighborsRegression` `DecisionTreeRegressor` `Hyperparameter Tuning`

- ‚ôªÔ∏è [Energy saved from recycling](https://github.com/gpozzi/python-analytics-projects/tree/main/energy_saved): Data cleaning and wrangling project, in which I had to clearly display how much energy the Singapore government saved by implementing recycling policies. `Python` `Data cleaning` `Data wrangling` `Pandas`
