🏘️ [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/acamica-data-scientist/house_price_prediction): I have recently joined the Data team of a large real estate company.

To do this, I should develop a Machine Learning model that, given certain characteristics of the property, predicts its sale price.
