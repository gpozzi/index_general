- üöï **[Analysis of demand patterns for Boro taxis](https://github.com/gpozzi/capstone-google-analytics/blob/main/README.md)**: Comprehensive data analysis of a fictitious business case done for Google Data Analytics Professional certificate. I‚Äôll be playing the role of a new Data Analyst for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. It's my first week on the job, and I just received an email from the Lead Dispatcher asking for the design of a dashboard to put data to a good use. **`Pandas`** **`SQL Server Studio`** **`Tableau`** **`Figma`** **`Google Slides`** **`Data extraction`** **`Data cleaning`** **`Presentation`** **`Dashboard design`** **`Data analysis`**

- üê∂ **[Dognition](https://github.com/gpozzi/sql-projects/tree/main/managing-big-data-with-sql/dognition)**: MySQL scripts that query a database of a company that sells dogs personality tests. A thorough data exploration has been performed to figure out what business changes it could implement to increase the number of tests users complete on their website. **`MySQL`** **`Exploratory Data Analysis`**

- üí¨ **[Natural Language Processing: rating prediction](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/acamica-data-scientist/nlp)**: The goal of this project is to be able to predict the score that a user would set given a review by using an Amazon dataset that contained reviews about different products. **`Python`** **`Supervised Machine Learning: classification`** **`Exploratory Data Analysis`** **`Stemming`** **`Lemmatization`** **`Seaborn`** **`Matplotlib`** **`Wordcloud`** **`Tf-Idf`** **`GaussianNB`** **`Random Forest`** **`LinearSVC`** **`GridsearchCV`**

- üèÖ **[Olympics dashboard](https://github.com/gpozzi/data-visualization/tree/main/olympics-dashboard)**: Given a dataset with 271.116 athletes that participated into different Olympics editions from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, I developed a dashboard to capture the history of the Olympic Games. **`Dataviz`** **`Tableau`** **`Figma`**.

- üèòÔ∏è **[Real estate price prediction](https://github.com/gpozzi/machine-learning/tree/master/acamica-data-scientist/house_price_prediction)**: I have recently joined the Data team of a large real estate company. The first task assigned is to help appraisers value properties, as it's a difficult and sometimes subjective process. To do this, I should develop a Machine Learning model that, given certain characteristics of the property, predicts its sale price. **`Python`** **`Supervised Machine Learning: classification`** **`Exploratory Data Analysis`** **`Preprocessing`** **`Seaborn`** **`Matplotlib`** **`LinearRegression`** **`KNeighborsRegression`** **`DecisionTreeRegressor`** **`Hyperparameter Tuning`**

- ‚ôªÔ∏è **[Energy saved from recycling](https://github.com/gpozzi/python-analytics-projects/tree/main/energy_saved)**: Data cleaning and wrangling project, in which I had to clearly display how much energy the Singapore government saved by implementing recycling policies. **`Python`** **`Data cleaning`** **`Data wrangling`** **`Pandas`**

- üöÄ **[Rocket launches, a best value analysis](https://github.com/gpozzi/python-analytics-projects/tree/main/space_launches)**: Data cleaning and wrangling project in which I applied transformation and data cleaning techniques to a messy dataset to detect which countries are able to launch rockets have the lowest average price per kilo that can launch rockets into Low Earth Orbit **`Python`** **`Data cleaning`** **`Data wrangling`** **`Pandas`**

- üí∞ **[#mavencrowdfundingchallenge](https://github.com/gpozzi/data-visualization/tree/main/crowdfunding)**: Given a dataset with over 375.000 projects uploaded to Kickstarter, had to analyze which factors may predict projects success. **`Dataviz`** **`Tableau`**

- üëî **[Dillards (WIP)](https://github.com/gpozzi/sql-projects/tree/main/managing-big-data-with-sql/dillards)**: exploratory data analysis queries to figure out relevant data about Dillard's sales dataset. **`SQL`** **`Teradata Viewpoint`** **`Exploratory Data Analysis`**
